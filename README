8pen is innovative keyboard replacement introduced by 3qubits for Android. This is an experimental HTML5 version of it. Improvements and modifications are highly appreciated.

I wrote this app also to the purpose of learning new technologies that appear under the buzz word "HTML5":

-local.storage
-cache.manifest
-apple-mobile-web-app-capable
-Mobile Safari's Touch API
-HTML5 DOCTYPE and elements like <section>
